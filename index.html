   <i><h1>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h1></i>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS
        files.However,
        <span>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span>
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by javaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, selector are used to target a specific element or a range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
